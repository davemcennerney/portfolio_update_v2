            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>So, in this section you can find out more about me; what my past experiences are, and my hopes and dreams for the future.  As mentioned on my <a href="index.html">Home page</a> I have been in the military for the past 12 years.  I am currently in the Royal Marines Band Service as a Trumpet and Violin player.  I have had a wonderful career so far in a great organistaion that has taught me a lot and given me many valuable experiences, as well as meeting a lot of great people.  I have travelled to many parts of the world which I would otherwise not have visited and played music in many of the great concert halls across the globe.  I have gained leadership experience and it has made me understand the importance of working as a team.  I have very fond memories of my time in the military and will be sad to leave, but for me it is time to follow a new path.  Below you can see some of my experiences during my time in the Royal Marines Band Service.
