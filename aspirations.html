        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by the digital world and how quickly it grows and progresses, but I have never had the time to delve into it due to my attention being mainly on music.  Now is my opportunity to scratch that itch!  I have just started my final year in the military and I am going use my spare time during this period to learn the skills I need to make this career change.  It has been difficult to decide in which areas to study to give me the best possible chance for employment when the time comes.  I have now settled on three areas that I shall concentrate on:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>I have enrolled on a Tech Degree course with an online company called Treehouse.  Their mission is to offer affordable technology education to people everywhere in order to help them acheive their dreams and change the world.  Sounds pretty good right? The Tech Degree programme sold it for me as you complete projects along the way through your learning, which can help build a portfolio and is a great way to test your newly learnt skills.  Treehouse is where I hope to gain a lot of my coding and techincal skills. You can take a look for yourself here: <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">www.teamtreehouse.com</a></li>
          
          <li>Secondly, I am also a lifetime member of another online educator, but this time they have a broader list of courses availiable in a variety of subjects.  They are called The Shaw Academy, based in Ireland.  Their course consists of live online Webinars where you gain a diploma or advanced diploma in the subject you study.  What drew me to them is the variety of courses that could aid me with my (hopefully) future career.  For example, I have completed a Diploma in Digital Marketing and am going on to do the advanced course soon.  They also offer courses in Photoshop, Web Development, Photography and more.  Some of which I hope to complete as they will only aid my progression and skill set as a Web Designer.  You can find them here: <a href="http://www.shawacademy.com">www.shawacademy.com</a></li>
          
          <li>Finally, I am also going to gain my Prince2 qualification in Project Management, alongside an Agile Project Management course.  I feel these skills will be invaluable in the Digital World and I hope, once having gained enough skills and experience, that I can move into a Digital Project Manager role.</li>
        
        </ol>
